President Obama: “The election four years ago was never about me. It was about you. You were the change.”
President Obama: “Change can’t happen if you write off half the nation before you even take office.”
President Obama: “I’m not fighting to improve red state schools or blue state schools—I’m fighting to improve schools in the United States.”
